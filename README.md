# react-component-library
component library for React project, with storybook and testing.

This is a React boiler-plate code for starting a component library project without using create-react-app.
Im using webpack, styled-components, eslint, and present the library with Storybook library.
I added some addons to storybook which i thought were nice. This will help you understand how it is done and also 
will make your storybook more interactive, allowing you to present all features of your components.     
As to make this project comprehansive i added testing capabilities using Jest and Enzyme. 
There is only one component but i'm sure you can take it from here. 

Have fun
